Hallowed is my crown
And it's not the rust you rhyme
And hold head down
And inside were ripened tides
Head hold, barely love in this
Unfurl this throne
Head hold, barely love in this
Lost love is scorn
No, it's never what I wanted it to be
And when you fall you can make it all seem real
All this time have you been waiting for a change
All I tell you is that everything's the same
No, it's never what I wanted it to be
And when you fall you can make it all seem real
All this time have you been waiting for a change
All I tell you is that everything's the same
I harbor it all, I harbor it all
I harbor, I harbor, I harbor it all
No... No... No... No...
